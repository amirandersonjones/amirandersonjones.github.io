## Welcome to My Humble Abode!

Thank you for stopping in today. I will be taking you on a tour around my dream house. Sit tight, and enjoy the view from your computer. I look forward to giving you this tour. While you're here feel free to relax and unwind. The view is gorgeous! I hope you enjoy these images as much as I enjoyed them. Take notes on any updates that you feel would look great in your own home. I'll see you at the BOTTOM. Once again, thanks and enjoy. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/amirandersonjones/amirandersonjones.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Interior Design

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Exterior Design

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/amirandersonjones/amirandersonjones.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
